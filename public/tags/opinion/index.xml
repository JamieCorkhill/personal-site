      <description>It certainly would not be erroneous to state that, more often than not, feeling the need to write comments implies a problem with underlying design - that the code itself leaves something to be desired. Code should be expressive and interfaces should be intention-revealing. If you get this right, you rarely need comments. The notion of behavior, not mere data, should be treated as first-class.
It would make sense, then, to extrapolate this idea and say that comment usage itself is an anti-pattern.</description>
